1. idea for apps:
- social networking app for people who want to find partners for their start up.
- stopwatch that can stop by pressing volume button.
- carpool app for student

future
- most of the features would be free of charge but when app move up more advance,
users can pay a little bit of a fee for premium features. However it won’t be really bias

every result. They also have filter for deep searching.

age can use it. I haven’t heard anyone complaining that it is hard to use
- YouTube: YouTube layout is simple enough that a five year old baby can use it.
